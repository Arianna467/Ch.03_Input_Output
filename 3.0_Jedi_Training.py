import math

# 1.) Write a program that asks someone for their name and then prints a greeting that uses their name.
# username = input("Hello! What is your name? ")
# print("Hello, ", username,", how are you doing today?")

# 2. Write a program where a user enters a base and height and you print the area of a triangle.
# base = float(input("What is the base of your triangle? "))
# height = float(input("What is the height of your triangle? "))
# area = (base*height)/2
# print("The area of the triangle was ",area," cm^2)")

# 3. Write a line of code that will ask the user for the radius of a circle and then prints the circumference.
# r = float(input("What is the radius of the circle? "))
# c = (2*math.pi*r)
# print("The circumference of your circle is ",c," meters.")

# 4. Ask a user for an integer and then print the square root.
# n = float(input("What number did you want to square root? "))
# sr = math.sqrt(n)
# print("The square root of ",n," is ",sr,".")

# 5. Good Star Wars joke: "May the mass times acceleration be with you!" because F=ma. 
#    Ask the user for mass and acceleration and then print out the Force on one line and "Get it?" on the next.
mass = float(input("What is the mass? "))
acc = float(input("What is the acceleration? "))
force = mass*acc
print("May the ",mass*acc," be with you!")
print("Get it?")
# print("I want to print a double quote "\"right here")
